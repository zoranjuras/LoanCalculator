<p>Computers are known for their ability to do things that people consider to be boring and energy-consuming. For example, repeating identical tasks without any errors is one of these things. In this topic, we'll learn what Python tool can help you with that, how to implement it, and what functions you can use along with it.</p><h5 id="what-is-iteration">What is iteration?</h5><p>In Python, the process of repetitive <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, execution refers to the process of running a program or script, where the Python interpreter reads and executes each line of code in the script sequentially. | This process involves converting the source code into bytecode, which is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The PVM interprets the bytecode and performs the necessary operations, such as arithmetic and logical operations, input/output operations, and function calls.">execution</a> of the same <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6270" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A block of code in Python refers to a group of consecutive lines of code that are executed as a single unit. | It is typically defined by a header line, also known as a line that starts with a keyword such as 'if', 'for', 'while', or 'def'. The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">block of code</a> is called an <strong>iteration</strong>.</p><p>There are two types of iteration:</p><p><strong>Definite iteration</strong>, where the number of repetitions is stated in advance.</p><p><strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5940" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Indefinite iteration in Python refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. | Unlike definite iteration, where the number of repetitions is predetermined, indefinite iteration continues until the condition is no longer satisfied. This type of iteration is often implemented using the 'while' loop in Python, which checks the condition before each iteration and executes the code block if the condition is true.">Indefinite iteration</a></strong>, where a code block executes as long as the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5932" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a 'condition' typically refers to a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False. | Conditions are often used in control flow structures, such as if statements, to determine which code to execute based on the result of the condition. For example, an if statement might check if a variable is greater than a certain value, and if so, execute a block of code. The expression being checked (e.g. variable &gt; value) is the condition.">condition</a> stated in advance is true.</p><p>After the first iteration, the program comes back to the beginning of the code's body and repeats it, making a so-called <strong>loop</strong>. The most popular is the <code class="language-python">for</code><strong> </strong>loop<strong>, </strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a name is a unique identifier given to a variable, function, or any other object. | It's essentially a label that distinguishes one object from another in the same scope. This concept is not unique to Python, as most programming languages have some form of naming system for their entities. However, Python's dynamic typing and use of names as references to objects, rather than directly storing values, make its naming system particularly important to understand.">named</a> after the <code class="language-python">for</code><strong> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An operator in Python is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more values (operands) to produce a result. | Examples of operators include arithmetic operators like `+` and `-`, comparison operators like `&lt;` and `&gt;`, and logical operators like `and` and `or`.">operator</a></strong>, which provides the code's execution. <code class="language-python">For</code> loops are usually considered to be definite. </p><h5 id="for-loop-syntax">For loop syntax</h5><p>Here is the scheme of the loop:</p><pre><code class="language-python">for variable in iterable:
